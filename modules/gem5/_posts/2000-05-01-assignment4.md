## Introduction

In this assignment, you'll be investigating the performance impacts of different cache architectures and different algorithm designs on matrix multiplication.
The goals of this assignment are:

- ShowÂ how algorithms have different behaviors as the microarchitecture changes.
- Show how changing the algorithm can change performance on the *same* microarchitecture.
- Improve your understanding of cache architectures.

## Research question

**How does the cache hierarchy and the algorithm design affect the performance of matrix multiplication?**

To answer this question, you will have to implement different matrix multiplication algorithms and run them on different cache hierarchies.

## Workload

In this assignment, you are going to implement different techniques for multiplying matrices.
All the ready-made workloads discussed require one input argument.
You will have to pass `matrix_size` as an input argument to the constructor of a workload (`__init__`) which describes the size of matrices `A`, `B`, and `C`.
When running the workload on native hardware (e.g., your host machine), you should pass the same **one** argument in the command line following the name of your binary.

**NOTE**: for all the parts of this assignment assume:

$C = A \times B$

You will have to implement different techniques for matrix multiplications to see the effect of software implementation on the overall system performance.
Below you can see a short description of your starter code.

### Base matrix multiplication algorithm (C stationary, or ijk)

In programming, matrices are stored as two-dimensional arrays.
Otherwise, a matrix is stored as an array of arrays.
There are two ways how a matrix could be stored this way.

- Row major order: the matrix is represented as an array of the rows of the matrix.
Each row is then stored as an array that includes elements from consecutive columns in the row.
With this order, consecutive access to the elements in a row exhibits spatial locality.
- Column major order: the matrix is represented as an array of the columns of the matrix.
Each column is then stored as an array that includes elements from consecutive rows in the column.
With this order, consecutive access to the elements in a column exhibits spatial locality.

Below is a simple implementation of matrix multiplication given in `workloads/matmul/ijk_multiply.h`.
For this assignment, assume that all `A`, `B`, and `C` matrices are stored in row-major order.
I.e., matrices are indexed like `A[row number][column number]`.
The starter code first iterates over the rows of `A` (*i*), then iterates over the columns of `B` (*j*), and then iterates over the elements in the selected row and column (*k*).

```cpp
void multiply(double **A, double **B, double **C, int size)
{
    for (int i = 0; i < size; i++) {
        for (int j = 0; j < size; j++) {
            for (int k = 0; k < size; k++) {
                C[i][j] += A[i][k] * B[k][j];
            }
        }
    }
}
```

The animation below shows how the order of operations during the multiplication operation.

![matrix multiplication](images/mm_ijk.gif)

You can import this workload into your configuration script using `obtain_resource("mm_ijk_run")`.

However, if you need to compile your own binary, you can run the command below in `workloads/matmul`.

```sh
make mm-ijk-gem5
```

**CAUTION**: The above command generates a binary that could only be run with gem5.
Running these binaries on your host will result in errors.

### A stationary matrix multiplication (ikj)

As you can see in the animation, the previous implementation of the matrix multiplication does not expose much locality in its accesses to matrices `A` and `B`.
Rather, it exposes locality when accessing matrix `C`.
We can reorder our nested loops and still get the correct answer.
In fact, all permutations of our three nested loops will result in the same `C` matrix.
Moreover, when it comes to the complexity of the algorithm itself, reordering the for loops does not change the complexity.
However, reordering the for loops changes the access pattern to the memory.
In turn, it could increase/decrease our cache hit rate.
For this step, you can see a slightly different implementation of the matrix multiplication program below.
You can also find it in `workloads/matmul/ikj_multiply.h`

```cpp
void multiply(double **A, double **B, double **C, int size)
{
    for (int i = 0; i < size; i++) {
        for (int k = 0; k < size; k++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < size; j++) {
                C[i][j] += A[i][k] * B[k][j];
            }
        }
    }
}
```

As you can see, two for loops have been interchanged (*j* and *k*) from our previous implementation.
The animation below shows how the order of operations during the multiplication operation.

![matrix multiplication](images/mm_ikj.gif)

You can import this workload into your configuration script using `obtain_resource("mm_ikj_run")`.

If you need to compile your own binary, you can run the command below in `workloads/matmul`.

```shell
make mm-ikj-gem5
```

**CAUTION**: The above command generates a binary that could only be run with gem5.
Running these binaries on your host will result in multiple errors.

### Blocked matrix multiplication

You can improve the cache behavior of matrix multiplication by using a blocked algorithm.
In this algorithm, rather than streaming through all of the inputs, you operate on one *block* at a time.
Look at [this short article](https://csapp.cs.cmu.edu/public/waside/waside-blocking.pdf) to learn more about the blocking technique used to increase locality in matrix multiplication.

Similar to loop interchange, there are multiple different ways you can choose to block accesses to your matrices in the matrix multiplication algorithm.
One example is shown below where `j` and `k` are blocked and `i` is streamed.

![blocked matrix multiplication](images/mm_blocked.gif)

For this assignment, you need to implement three different variants of the blocking scheme.

- Block *i* and *j* and implement it as the multiply function in `workloads/matmul/block_ij_multiply.h`.
After implementation, you can build your binary by running the command below in `workload/matmul`.

```shell
make mm-block-ij-gem5
```

After building your binary, you can import it as a workload into your configuration script from `workloads/matmul_workload.py` as `obtain_resource("mm_block_ij_run")`.

- Block *i* and *k* and implement it as the multiply function in `workloads/matmul/block_ik_multiply.h`.
After implementation, you can build your binary by running the command below in `workload/matmul`.

```shell
make mm-block-ik-gem5
```

After building your binary, you can import it as a workload into your configuration script from `workloads/matmul_workload.py` as `obtain_resource("mm_block_ik_run")`.

- Block *j* and *k* and implement it as the multiply function in `workloads/matmul/block_jk_multiply.h`.
After implementation, you can build your binary by running the command below in `workload/matmul`.

```shell
make mm-block-jk-gem5
```

After building your binary, you can import it as a workload into your configuration script from `workloads/matmul_workload.py` as `obtain_resource("mm_block_jk_run")`.

You will have to pass `matrix_size` (describes the size of matrices `A`, `B`, and `C`) and `block_size` (describes the size of the block in your blocking scheme) to the constructor of all the workloads you have implemented.
If you have to run a workload on native hardware (e.g. your host machine), you should pass the same **two** arguments in the same order in the command line following the name of your binary.

**NOTE**: You can use the command below in `workloads/matmul` to create the binaries for all the workloads discussed.

```shell
make
```

**CAUTION**: The above command generates binaries that can only be run with gem5.
Running these binaries on your host will result in multiple errors.

### Testing your blocked implementation

To test your blocked implementation you may want to run it on your local machine (or on the codespace you're using).
To do this, see [Running on native hardware](#step-iv-running-on-native-hardware) below.

## Experimental setup

In this assignment, we will investigate the effect of caching on overall performance.
We have already looked at how software implementation can help improve caching in matrix multiplication.
Regarding hardware models, we will use different cache hierarchies to see the effect of cache size and latency on the performance.
Under the `components` directory, you will find modules that define the different models that you should use in your configuration scripts.

- Board models: You will use the `RISCVBoard`.
- Board models: You will use the `OutOfOrderCPU`. This component uses the O3CPU with all the default parameters.
- Cache models: You can find all the models you need to use for your cache hierarchy under `components/cache_hierarchies.py`.

You can find three models for your cache hierarchy.
They all have an L2 cache with size of `128 KiB`.
They also have the same L1I cache.
However, there are different L1D cache designs.
You can find a short description of each L1D design below.

- LargeCache: a `64 KiB` L1D cache.
- MediumCache: a `32 KiB` L1D cache.
- SmallCache: a `16 KiB` L1D cache.

Make sure you understand their similarities and differences.

- Memory models: You will use the `DDR4` memory.
- Clock frequency: You can use a clock frequency of `2 GHz` for all of your simulations.

## The experiments

As part of your analysis and simulation, you will have to run your workloads on both real hardware and gem5.
Before running any workloads, you should develop your hypotheses as to what the performance will be.
Specifically, the main thing that is changing will be the *hit rate* in the L1 caches.
You can estimate the hit rate by estimating the *active* working set size and comparing it to the cache size.
Working set size is the number of bytes that have to be moved between the processor and the memory subsystem.

### Step I: Working set sizes

In your report answer the following questions.

1. What is the working set size for the matrix multiply application?
Describe the working set size as a function of `matrix_size` and the size of a double `double_size`.
Plug in 128 as `matrix_size` and 8 as `double_size` and calculate the working set size.
Give both the answer and the equation you used to calculate it.
2. For each of the three blocking configurations, what's the *active working set* for multiplying *one block*?
Describe the working set size as a function of `matrix_size`, `block_size`, and `double_size`.
Plug in 128 as `matrix_size`, 8 as `block_size`, and 8 as `double_size`.
3. Given your answers, for the "SmallCache" that is 16 KiB, which implementation do you think will perform the best?

For these questions, you can assume the cache line size is 64 bytes.

### Step II: Simulation and performance comparison

For your simulation, create a configuration script that allows you to run any of the workloads with any of the cache hierarchies.
For this step:

- Run all the workloads on using the `SmallCache` hierarchy.

In your report answer the following questions.

1. For `SmallCache`, which blocking scheme performs the best? Why?

Use a `matrix_size` of 128 and a `block_size` of 8 for all your simulations.

**Hints**: In your answer use cache-related statistics such as `hit rate`.
Moreover, think of how **a**verage **m**emory **a**ccess **t**ime (**AMAT**) could help you explain your results.
I also recommend thinking about how the access pattern could influence memory access time.

The stats that are most useful will be:

- `board.cache_hierarchy.ruby_system.l1_controllers.L1Dcache.m_demand_hits`
- `board.cache_hierarchy.ruby_system.l1_controllers.L1Dcache.m_demand_misses`
- `board.cache_hierarchy.ruby_system.l1_controllers.L1Dcache.m_demand_accesses`
- `board.cache_hierarchy.ruby_system.l2_controllers0.L2cache.m_demand_hits`
- `board.cache_hierarchy.ruby_system.l2_controllers0.L2cache.m_demand_misses`
- `board.cache_hierarchy.ruby_system.l2_controllers0.L2cache.m_demand_accesses`

> Note: There are four L2 controllers, but they represent different banks of the same cache. The miss ratio should be the same for all of them.

### Step III: Comparing cache size effects

Now, run the same workloads on the `LargeCache` hierarchy.

In your report answer the following questions.

1. Which blocking schemes benefit the most from the larger cache?
2. Why does the non-blocked implementation not benefit as much from the larger cache?

### Next steps (required 201A, extra credit 154B): Running on native hardware

Now, run the matrix multiply workloads on some real hardware (not gem5).
Use the codespace to run the experiments.

```shell
make all-native
```

You can also build them separately using the commands below.

```shell
make mm-block-ij-native
```

```shell
make mm-block-ik-native
```

```shell
make mm-block-jk-native
```

Before running your workloads on real hardware, answer the following questions in your report.

1. What is the L1/L2/L3 size of the processor you're running on? (`lscpu` or `/proc/cpuinfo` and Google should help)
2. Can you use the information about the cache sizes to predict the best-performing block scheme and size?

When running on native hardware, I recommend using `matrix_size` of at least as big as 256.
After running the workloads on real hardware answer the following question in your report.

3. Which blocking scheme and size exhibited the best performance? Why or why not?
4. Is this the same as on gem5? Why or why not?
