### Instructor

**Professor Jason Lowe-Power** (<jlowepower@ucdavis.edu>).

I prefer Jason, but will likely respond if you say "professor \<something\>".
My pronouns are he/him/his.

Please contact me via email if you have a personal request, *not* canvas messages.
**I do not check canvas messages.**
For class-wide questions (e.g., anything more than one person might be interested to know), please use the [online discussion](#discussion).

#### Office hours

*Office Hours*: TBD.

*Office Location*: Kemper 3049.

These office hours can be used to discuss anything you would like.
The discussion topic doesn't have to be class related or even computer architecture related.
If you need to discuss something in private, let me know (e.g., via chat on zoom) and I can create a waiting room for others while we talk privately.

<!-- *Online office*: [Zoom link](https://ucdavis.zoom.us/my/jlowepower) (<https://ucdavis.zoom.us/my/jlowepower>). -->
<!-- I'll be connected on Zoom during in person office hours. -->

Please suggest a meeting time when you email me for an appointment.
You can use [my calendar](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/embed?src=jlowepower%40ucdavis.edu&ctz=America%2FLos_Angeles) to quickly find a time I am available.
It's not guaranteed to be completely up-to-date, but it gives a good starting point.

## Class Resources

### Online material

All of the material for this course is online.
We will use [this website]({{'/' | relative_url}}) as the main website and entry point for all course information.
This will also include links to all of the lecture videos and quizzes.
You can find the source for this website on [GitHub](https://github.com/jlpteaching/comparch).
If you find any errors or have ideas for improving the website, please [open an issue](https://github.com/jlpteaching/comparch/issues) on GitHub.
Helpful contributions can be rewarded with [extra credit]({{'/extra-credit' | relative_url}}).

### Gradescope

We will use [Gradescope](https://www.gradescope.com/courses/216663) for all assignments including lab submissions and returning quizzes, the midterm, and the final.
Gradescope gives you a graded PDF version of your test, along with a rubric, immediately after we're done grading.
You will receive an email from Gradescope to make your account early in the quarter.

All lab assignments will be autograded by Gradescope.
When you upload your code to Gradescope, a set of tests will be run on it and your grade *will be immediately available*.
You may submit your code any number of times.
Only the final submission will be accepted as the grade for your assignment.
However, if you submit after the deadline, the [late policy](#late-assignments) applies.

### Online discussions

We will use [Campuswire](https://campuswire.com/c/G03D9D0A1/) for class discussions outside of the classroom.
If your question is specific to either 201A or 154B please start the subject with `[ECS 201A]` or `[ECS 154B]` respectively.

It's best to ask your questions on Campuswire.
That way, all of your classmates can see the answer instead of emailing the TAs or me.
Additionally, you might get a much faster response from one of your classmates!
Through asking and answering questions on Discord, you improve your understanding of the material, and improve other students' understanding as well.

### Regrade Requests

Regrade requests must be made within one week of the return of the assignment or test.
Regrade requests should be made in office hours or by appointment.

### Accommodations

The exam schedule is available on the [main page]({{'/' | relative_url}}).
Per official UC Davis policy, if you have an accommodation request from the [Student Disability Center](https://sdc.ucdavis.edu/), or have any conflicts with exam times for religious observances, you must notify me **by the fourth class, January 18, 2023**.
If you do not notify me by this time, I cannot guarantee I will be able to make the accommodation.

For **each** test, quiz, etc. you must reach out to me *one week in advance* to schedule specific accommodations for that test, quiz, etc.
If you do not notify me by this time, I cannot guarantee I will be able to make the accommodation.

## Academic Misconduct

Academic misconduct is a serious issue.
You can find the official UC Davis policy on the [Office of Student Support and Judicial Affairs](http://sja.ucdavis.edu/) website.

You are expected to *cite all of the work you reference*.
Any ideas that are not specifically yours or generally known (e.g., caches hold data) should have a citation.
When in doubt, cite.

You may not, under any circumstances, post the code you write publicly.
This means you *cannot create public forks* of the template code repository.
If we find any of the class's code beyond the template files distributed, we will report this violation to SJA.

Any violations of this policy will result in reporting the violating student(s) to the Office of Student Support and Judicial Affairs.
This can result in a 0 on the assignment or an F in the class.
See the [Computer Science Department's policy](https://www.cs.ucdavis.edu/blog/academic-misconduct-policy/) for more information.

## Student Support

There is a lot of great information on the [Coronovirus Update Page](https://studentaffairs.ucdavis.edu/news/coronavirus-update) with extensive [FAQs](https://studentaffairs.ucdavis.edu/news/coronavirus-faqs) and specific [student support information](https://studentaffairs.ucdavis.edu/news/coronavirus-faqs#support) in this unique circumstance.

If you need access to computing resources, internet, etc. there's lots of good information on the [Keep Teaching webpage](https://keepteaching.ucdavis.edu/student-resources).

As a student you may experience a range of issues that can cause barriers to learning, such as strained relationships, increased anxiety, alcohol/drug problems, feeling down, difficulty concentrating and/or lack of motivation.
These mental health concerns or stressful events may lead to diminished academic performance or reduce a student’s ability to participate in daily activities.
UC Davis is committed to advancing the mental health and well-being of its students.
If you or someone you know is feeling overwhelmed, depressed, and/or in need of support, services are available.
You can learn more about the broad range of confidential mental health services available on campus via [Student Health and Counseling Services](https://shcs.ucdavis.edu/).

You can also contact me during office hours, via email, or by making a separate office hour appointment: [jlowepower@ucdavis.edu](mailto:jlowepower@ucdavis.edu).
If you need additional accommodations due to these or other personal issues, don't hesitate to ask.
I cannot guarantee that I will be able to make accommodations.
However, reaching out to me earlier will increase the likelihood that I can make accommodations.

### What happens if I get a positive COVID test?

**Do not come to class!**

All classes will be recorded.

If you are not feeling well or test positive before an exam, contact Prof Jason Lowe-Power *immediately*.
We can make accomidations *only before* the exam.
**DO NOT** come to the exam if you are sick.

## Prerequisites

### ECS 154B Prereqs

ECS 154A; or both EEC 170 and EEC 180A.

Although not an official prereq, this course requires experience with many programming tools (e.g., Linux, command line, git, etc.).
A good resource is a recent MIT course on "[The missing semester](https://missing.csail.mit.edu/)" which teaches these important tools that aren't necessarily covered in a "normal" computer science curriculum.

### ECS 201A Prereqs

Introduction to computer architecture, computer organization, introduction to operating system, datastructures and algorithms.

Although not an official prereq, this course requires experience with many programming tools (e.g., Linux, command line, git, etc.).
A good resource is a recent MIT course on "[The missing semester](https://missing.csail.mit.edu/)" which teaches these important tools that aren't necessarily covered in a "normal" computer science curriculum.

## PTAs

Before asking for a PTA, be sure that you have read the [Department of Computer Science's PTA Policy](http://www.cs.ucdavis.edu/blog/pta-policy/).
PTA numbers will only be issued after the 12th day of instruction, and PTA numbers are only issued for extenuating circumstances related to graduation.

## Assignments and Tests

I understand the need for more flexibility.
Many of us will have responsibilities beyond just school since we are living at home.
I'm sure many of you will be taking care of loved ones, working, or have other responsibilities that may conflict with this class.
I will do everything I can to accommodate individual circumstances while maintaining fairness in the class.
The most important thing is that **the earlier you communicate with me the more likely I will be able to make accommodations**.

### Participation

I want to encourage participation in my classes.
I believe that learning is a two way street, and that it's important for you to participate to get the full learning experience.
Therefore, I encourage participation by making part of your grade dependent on it.

10% of your grade comes from actively participating in class (defined broadly).
You are expected to participate on [online discussions](#online-discussions), [discussion section discussions](#discussions), **or** [office hours](#office-hours).

You are required to attend and participate (say something at least once) in one [discussion section](#discussions) each week.
We prefer you to attend the one you sign up for, but you can attend any.
**Every week counts as two points on your final grade.**
Thus, if you attend your discussion section each week, you will receive the full points for participation.

However, we understand that this won't necessarily be possible for everyone to attend every week.
Therefore, you you can also get participation points by using our [online discussion](#online-discussions).
Participating in [online discussion](#online-discussions) can earn you up to 5 points.
Each week a thread will be posted with a discussion topic to help generate substantive conversations.

Finally, you can also earn points by attending and participating in office hours.
For each office hour you attend (and we have a substantive conversation), you can earn one participation point up to 5 points.

### Projects

#### ECS 154B Project: DINO CPU

You will complete [five project-based assignments]({{"/modules/dino cpu/index/" | relative_url}}) throughout this course.
The assignments can be found via the links below.
All together, the labs are worth 40% of your final grade.

Labs are due at 11:59 PM on the date listed below.

* [Assignment 1]({{"/modules/dino cpu/assignment1/" | relative_url}}) (2 weeks, 8%). Due 1/20.
* [Assignment 2]({{"/modules/dino cpu/assignment2/" | relative_url}}) (1 weeks, 8%). Due 1/27.
* [Assignment 3.1]({{"/modules/dino cpu/assignment3/" | relative_url}}) (1 week, 4%). **Soft deadline** 2/6.
* [Assignment 3.2]({{"/modules/dino cpu/assignment3/" | relative_url}}#part-ii-implementing-forwarding) (1 week, 4%). Due 2/17.
* [Assignment 4]({{"/modules/dino cpu/assignment4/" | relative_url}}) (2 weeks, 8%). Due 3/3.
* [Assignment 5]({{"/modules/dino cpu/assignment5/" | relative_url}}) (2 weeks, 8%). Due 3/17.

#### ECS 201A Projects: gem5

You will complete five project-based assignments throughout this course.
The assignments can be found via the links below.
All together, the labs are worth 40% of your final grade.

Labs are due at 11:59 PM on the date listed below.

* [Assignment 1]({{"/modules/gem5/assignment1/" | relative_url}}) (2 weeks, 8%). Due 1/20.
* [Assignment 2]({{"/modules/gem5/assignment2/" | relative_url}}) (1 week,  8%). Due 1/27.
* [Assignment 3]({{"/modules/gem5/assignment3/" | relative_url}}) (3 weeks, 8%). Due 2/17.
* [Assignment 4]({{"/modules/gem5/assignment4/" | relative_url}}) (2 weeks, 8%). Due 3/3.
* [Assignment 5]({{"/modules/gem5/assignment5/" | relative_url}}) (2 weeks, 8%). Due 3/17.

#### Late Projects

If you turn in a project assignment late, you will lose points.
The percentage of points you will lose is given by the equation below.
This will give you partial points up to 48 hours after the due date and penalizes you less if you barely miss the deadline.

$$ fraction \: of \: points = -1 \times \frac{ {hours \: late}^2}{48^2} + 1 $$

![Late policy graph](/img/late_policy.png)

Note: When submitting late, the reduction in points will not immediately appear in Gradescope.
Rest assured, we will go through and double check all of the submission times ;).

### Quizzes (154B Only)

There will be one canvas quiz each week (except for the test week).
Each quiz is worth 3% of your total grade.
You'll have two chances on the quizzes: The first will be due before discussion and is worth 100%.
The second chance is due 2 days later and you can retake the quiz to improve your score.
If you take the first version of the quiz, then you can make 100% on the second try.
If you don't attempt the first try, you can make at most 80% of the points.

(Note: I'm trying something new with Canvas here... hopefully it works out.)

### Perusall (201A Only)

Instead of quizzes you will read papers and collaboratively discuss them.

*Paper reviews are due **before discussion*** and there is no grace period.

### Tests

There will be two tests this quarter which together count for 35% of your grade.
There will be a test after the [processor architecture]({{"/modules/processor architecture/index/" | relative_url}}) module and a final after the [memory architecture]({{"/modules/memory architecture/index/" | relative_url}}), and [parallel architecture]({{"/modules/parallel architecture/index/" | relative_url}}) modules.

The tests will be administered *in person*.

## Textbooks

### ECS 154B Textbooks

In this class, we'll be closely following *Computer Organization and Design RISC-V Edition: The Hardware/Software Interface* by D. A. Patterson and J. L. Hennessy.

Importantly, you should get the *RISC-V edition*, not the ARM edition and not the MIPS edition. This is different from versions in years past.

There are two editions available: the first edition (unlabeled) and the second edition.
The second edition has some minor improvements, but the first edition will work as well.
The main improvements of the second edition are new "self evaluation" sections and a new section on accelerators.
If anything is required from a specific edition, it will be posted online.

To support remote instruction during Spring 2020, all textbooks available in digital format will be provided as e-books.
To access the e-books available for your courses, click on the BOOKSHELF option in the Canvas navigation menu.
You have Auto-Access for any required textbooks, but can opt out in the Bookshelf window if you make other arrangements for the text.

**IMPORTANT:** The textbook on Canvas/vitalsource is *opt out*.

Additionally, you may find *The RISC-V Reader: An Open Architecture Atlas* a useful companion, but this book is not required.
We will be implementing a RISC-V processor in this class and having a physical book with the RISC-V instructions described will be useful.
If you prefer to not buy yet another book (though I do think it's a useful book to have), you can also use the online version of [the RISC-V specification](https://riscv.org/specifications/).
Note: the specification has fewer pretty pictures than the book.

You can find these books at the [university bookstore](http://ucdavisstores.com/SelectTermDept) or through various sites online.

### ECS 201A Textbooks

*Computer Architecture: A Quantitative Approach* 6th Edition. John L. Hennessy and David A. Patterson.

This is a different book than the undergrad text [above](#ecs-154b-textbooks).
It covers most of the same topics, but at a deeper level.
